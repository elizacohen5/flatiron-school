// ~ challenges
// 1. [easy] Add another click event handler.
// 2. [medium] Add some non-click, non-submit event listener to the page.
// 3. [hard] Add an image, and a form with one text input to the page.
//    On submit, have the image change to the URL specified in the text input.
// 4. [bonus] Add an event handler to #today so that whenever some or all of its text is copied,
//    that text is set as the content of #sometime.
